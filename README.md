Latex assignments, projects and class notes done throughout my undergraduate degree at McGill University.

My most notable project is *Advanced Calculus (MATH 314)* in [~/FullClassNotes/MATH314_Notes.pdf](https://github.com/hexaquarks/Latex_Files/blob/main/FullClassNotes/MATH314_Notes.pdf), a document that was featured to the class by my teacher.
